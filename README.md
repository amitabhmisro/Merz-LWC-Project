- Salesfor LWC

Getting Started

This is an example of using an LWC on Salesforce standard detail page to help Customer service Representatives to fetch shipping status from fulfillment App by mkaing a fetch call.

Custom Object 

Shipment ( Shipment__c)
LWC : merzShipmentStatus

Challenges :

1. Fetch API was blocked due to CORS ( Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers missing )
2. Bypassed the block to get response by using chrome browser extension for test.
3. The API needs to be enable CORS.
